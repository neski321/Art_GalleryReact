            The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially "the Met," is located in New York City and is the largest art museum in the United States. Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among seventeen curatorial departments. The main building, located on the eastern edge of Central Park along Museum Mile, is by area one of the world's largest art galleries. There is also a much smaller second location at "The Cloisters" in Upper Manhattan that features medieval art.
